## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MySQL Server
- Git

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd edupath-college-finder
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm run install-all
```

### 3. Database Setup

#### Create MySQL Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE collegify;
USE collegify;
```

#### Create Tables
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  role ENUM('admin','student') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'student',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Students table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  mht_cet_cutoff FLOAT DEFAULT NULL,
  other_info JSON DEFAULT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Quiz results table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS quiz_results (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  answers JSON,
  suggested_branches JSON,
  score FLOAT,
  taken_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Colleges table (use your existing structure)
-- Make sure your colleges table has these columns:
-- id, college_name, branch, cutoff_percentile, category, region, fees, median_package, image_urls
```

### 4. Environment Configuration
```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=collegify
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here
PORT=5000
```

### 5. Create Admin User
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password_hash, role) VALUES 
('Admin', 'admin@edupath.com', '$2a$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi', 'admin');
-- Default password: password (please change in production)
```

### 6. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will run on:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

## College Matching Algorithm

The application uses a sophisticated matching algorithm that considers:

1. **Cutoff Match (40% weight)**: Direct comparison with college cutoff
2. **Category Match (30% weight)**: Exact category matching
3. **Region Preference (20% weight)**: Location-based matching
4. **Branch Preference (10% weight)**: Specialization matching

Match scores are calculated and colleges are ranked accordingly.

## Branch Recommendation System

The quiz system maps student responses to engineering branches:

- **Computer Engineering**: Software development, programming focus
- **Electronics & Telecom**: Hardware, circuits, communication systems
- **Civil Engineering**: Construction, infrastructure, structural design
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Manufacturing, automotive, industrial processes
- **Electrical Engineering**: Power systems, electrical machines, automation

## Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with salt rounds
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-based Access**: Admin and student role separation
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all endpoints
- **CORS Protection**: Configured for secure cross-origin requests

## Deployment

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Environment Variables (Production)
- Set strong JWT secret
- Configure production database
- Enable HTTPS
- Set proper CORS origins
